# Day 11 Notes – Testing & Async Processing

# Apex Testing

## Why Testing is Important
- Prevents bugs
- Improves reliability
- Ensures business logic works correctly
- Required in Salesforce deployment
- Helps maintain enterprise stability

## Types of Testing
- Unit Testing
- Functional Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing

## Benefits of Testing
- Better software quality
- Reduced failures
- Easier maintenance
- Safer deployments

# Asynchronous Apex

## Definition
Asynchronous Apex executes processes in the background instead of immediate execution.

## Advantages
- Better performance
- Faster user response
- Handles long-running tasks
- Improves scalability

## Types
- Future Methods
- Queueable Apex
- Batch Apex
- Scheduled Apex

# Difference Between Synchronous and Asynchronous Processing

| Synchronous | Asynchronous |
|---|---|
| Runs immediately | Runs in background |
| User waits for completion | User does not wait |
| Slower for heavy tasks | Better for long tasks |
| Blocking operation | Non-blocking operation |

---

# Examples of Async Processing
- Bulk email sending
- Report generation
- Notifications
- Data synchronization
- Large imports

---

# Reliability Engineering

## Reliability Means
The system continues working correctly even during failures.

## Reliability Challenges
- Server crashes
- Data corruption
- Network failures
- Partial transaction failures

## Solutions
- Proper testing
- Error handling
- Backup systems
- Async recovery mechanisms

---

# Scalability

## Meaning
Ability of a system to handle increasing users and data.

## Why Scalability Matters
Enterprise systems support:
- Thousands of users
- Large databases
- Continuous operations

---

# Important Enterprise Concepts

## Background Jobs
Tasks processed separately without affecting active users.

## Blocking Operations
Operations that make users wait until completion.

## Enterprise Software
Requires:
- Reliability
- Security
- Scalability
- Testing
- Performance optimization

# Revision Questions Answers

## 1. Why is testing important?
Testing prevents bugs and improves reliability.

## 2. What problems happen without testing?
System crashes, bugs, data loss, and incorrect functionality.

## 3. Difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution?
Synchronous runs immediately while asynchronous runs in the background.

## 4. Why do enterprise systems use background jobs?
To improve performance and avoid blocking operations.

## 5. Why should developers think about scalability?
Systems must support growing users and data efficiently.

## 6. Why are test cases important?
They validate whether software works correctly.

## 7. What happens when systems fail partially?
Data inconsistency and incomplete transactions may occur.

## 8. Why do large systems require reliability engineering?
To ensure stable operations and minimize downtime.

## 9. Why should enterprise software avoid blocking operations?
Blocking operations reduce performance and user experience.

## 10. Why is enterprise software different from small scripts?
Enterprise software handles complex large-scale operations and requires reliability, scalability, and security.
